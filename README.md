# MeasureTheory-Learning
Welcome! This is where I will document my progress on learning(partly reviewing) Measure Theory and (Hopefully Fourier Analysis if time permits)over Winter Break 2024.
Here I will track my progress and document challenges, etc.

## Learning Objectives
- **Riemann Integral**
- **Measurable Sets**
- **Outer Measures**
- **Premeasures**
- **Littlewood's Principles**
- tobecontinued(?)

## Structure
Each topic will have its own set of summaries and problem solutions with explanations and the thought process behind the solutions. There will also be an area where I document any challenges or strategies that I encounter.
